                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>A passionate web developer with strong skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I specialize in
                        creating responsive and visually appealing websites. My experience includes building detailed
                        clones of major platforms such as Amazon and Facebook, which helped me refine my skills in
                        replicating complex layouts and user interfaces. Additionally, I've worked on custom UI designs
                        for a range of projects, showcasing my creativity and design understanding. <br> Recently, I
                        completed a responsive burger website UI using Next.js at GIAIC, which allowed me to deepen my
                        expertise in modern web frameworks and responsive design principles. I am committed to
                        continuous learning and actively keep myself updated with emerging web technologies, enabling me
                        to stay ahead and integrate innovative solutions into my projects. This proactive approach
                        ensures that my work is both functional and aligned with current industry trends.</p>
